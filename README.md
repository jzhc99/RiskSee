In recent years, enterprise risk management has become one of the key topics in corporate governance. The regulators have slapped heavy fines on leading banks for their deficiency in internal controls. Many companies suffer from failures in their business operations, due to lack of robust risk management framework.

In Australia, itâ€™s mainly the large enterprises that have comprehensive risk management system in place. Most mid-sized companies only have a dedicated risk team but with risk management system absent. They usually use Excel, PowerPoint or Visio to draw isolated risk mapping, or to carry out risk reporting. Smaller companies don't even have a risk team, not to mention adopting a management system.

RiskSee is a web-based application that aims to help organisation manage operational risks in a smarter and easier way. 

RiskSee provides a one-stop shop solution for mid-sized companies, including flow chart management, risk and control mapping, incident management, to-do reminder, reporting, visualisation and automatic risk identification empowered by AI.

RiskSee would also be a good complement to the existing risk governance systems for large enterprises. Instead of replacing the existing system, RiskSee will be a productivity tool for the business, mainly to focus on fast flow chart drawing, more granular risk identification, team collaboration, and reporting.

This project was started back in November 2020. We have spent quite a lot of our spare time to complete some of the essential steps for a start-up, including the proof of concept with the demo developed. The founders are experienced in management consulting, project management, modelling and analytics.

If you have experience in front- and back-end development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, and more importantly, if you are interested in our project and are happy to invest your time in this, please flick an email to support@risksee.com! We appreciate the risk involved in such start-up projects, and at this stage we are not able to offer any cash compensation other than shares. 



Yours sincerely
